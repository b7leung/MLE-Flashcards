# Machine Learning Flashcards

These are 250+ flashcards I made as an exercise & reference for myself, to review everything from my years of ML research, classes, and independent study. Hopefully other people can benefit from them as well, for study or interview prep!

The PDFs in this repo are mostly for convenience. __Check out these presentation slide links for the most up to date and animated Q&A versions__, with additional links in the speaker notes:

# Intended Scope and Audience

This covers computer science, classical machine learning, and modern deep learning with an emphasis on computer vision & some NLP. It generally assumes a good foundation in these topics, and a lot of technical terminology is used. I think the approach might be different depending on your current experience:

* Already have a __good foundation in ML__: you can probably use them __as-is to review__ and fill in any missing knowledge gaps

* __Newer to ML__, this may provide a good overview of what is out there, and I'd suggest also __refering to other materials focused on education__ & learning (see "additional links" below)

# Contributing

Because of gaps in my understanding, and because the field is constantly changing, this is not meant to be a definitive resource. There may be errors in these slides, or things that I've missed. If so, feel free let me know!
