# Machine Learning Flashcards

250+ flashcards I made as an exercise & reference for myself, after from years of ML research, coursework, & independent study. Hopefully other people can benefit from them as well, for study or interview prep!

Topics covered includes: **computer science, classical ML, modern deep learning, 2D/3D computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, generative models**.

# Intended Scope and Audience

These flashcards generally assume a good foundation in these topics, and a lot of technical terminology is used. I think your approach might be different depending on your current experience:

* Already have a __good foundation in ML__: you can probably use them __as-is to review__ and fill in any missing knowledge gaps

* __Newer to ML__, this may provide a good overview of what is out there, and I'd suggest also __refering to other materials focused on education__ & learning (see "additional links" below)

Note that some topics are covered more comprehensively/accurately than others -- and because the field is constantly changing, this is not meant to be a definitive resource. There may be errors in these slides, or things that I've missed. If so, feel free let me know!

# Changelog

* **May 2025** -- Updated with topics in RL, NeRFs, gaussian splatting, generative models, LLMs, and VLMs. Switched to powerpoint due to better equation editing.
* **July 2022** -- Initial set of flashcards.
